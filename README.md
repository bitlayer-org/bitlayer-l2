# Bitlayer Overview

[Bitlayer](https://www.bitlayer.org) is the first Bitcoin security-equivalent layer 2 based on BitVM. It consists an EVM compatible chain/sequencer(bitlayer-l2) that can map BTC ecological assets and facilitate the entry of BTC users. Bitlayer-l2 is a fork of [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum).

## Bitlayerâ€™s Value Propositions
Due to the technical nature of Bitcoin, there exists a trade-off between "Security and Turing completeness" for Bitcoin layer2 solutions.

Bitlayer aims to resolve this dilemma and realize a Bitcoin layer 2 that is equally secure as Bitcoin and Turing complete through cryptographic innovations and blockchain protocol engineering. This is intended to ultimately foster a prosperous Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Technical Features
Bitlayer's core objective is to address the trade-off between security (trustless) and Turing completeness in BTC Layer 2. Based on this context, three key tasks are abstracted:

1. Trustless entry and exit of L1 assets
2. State transitions using a Turing-complete L2 virtual machine
3. L1 verification of the validity of L2 state transitions

Bitlayer innovatively utilizes the DLC/LN protocol to enable trustless bidirectional flow of signals/assets. It introduces VMs (EVM, SolanaVM, MoveVM, etc.) to support a wide range of state transition expressions.

## Architecture

Bitlayer subscribes to the typical model of an Optimistic Rollup equivalent.


## Roadmap

Bitlayer-l2 is the geth client in MAINNET-V1.

## Building the source

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.21 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Documentation

- The official documentation for the Bitlayer can be found [here](https://docs.bitlayer.org). It contains all the conceptual and architectural details of the chain along with operational guide for users running the nodes.
